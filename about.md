Hello, my name is Kocsen (*`KAHK-sen`*) Chung. I'm a software engineer going to [RIT](https://rit.edu) in upstate NY. 

I'm currently pursuing my degree in Software Engineering and I'm loving it.

My strongest languages are Python and Javascript. 
My recent hipster languages are `SmallTalk`, `Scheme` and `ImpCore`. 

*-- I do firmly believe that languages are nothing but a syntax mask over core logic and principles.* [Read this][lang-dont-matter]

See some of my stuff on [GitHub][gh], [Linkedin][linkedin] and [kocsen.com](http://kocsen.com).
